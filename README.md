# Postal-Code-Database
@author Andrey Skvortsov
A database in which a user can store addresses and their postal codes.

A grade 12 Computer Science course project to demonstrate proficiency with 2D arrays among other coding tools.
The program allows a user to add, delete and edit addresses stored under postal codes in a database. The user can also choose to display the entire database.
Note that the storage capacity of the database is 10 postal codes, each with 10 addresses. Further, more practical versions of such a program could
ask the user how big they want the database to be or could automatically set different database sizes to fulfill various purposes.

The entire program is written in Java and displays to a console.
