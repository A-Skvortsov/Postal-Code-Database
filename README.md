# Postal-Code-Database

Written in Java using Netbeans 8.2 IDE.

A grade 12 Computer Science course project to demonstrate proficiency with 2D arrays among other coding tools.
The program gives the user a console menu where they can choose to add, delete and edit addresses stored under postal codes in a database. The user can also choose to display the entire database. Note that the storage capacity of the database is 10 postal codes, each with 10 addresses (100 addresses total). Future, more practical versions of such a program could ask the user how big they want the database to be or could automatically set different database sizes to fulfill various purposes. Pictures of the console display are included.
